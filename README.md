# One-Click Installation of ShadowsocksR Server

This project offers a streamlined script for the rapid deployment of a **ShadowsocksR (SSR)** server on Linux-based systems, including CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu. Designed with modern compatibility in mind, the script incorporates updated components to ensure full support for environments running **Python 3.10+**, and delivers a robust, firewall-friendly proxy service for secure and reliable connectivity.

## Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to install ShadowsocksR:

1. **Download the Installation Script**:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samrand96/SSR-Updated/refs/heads/main/install.sh -O install-shadowsocksr.sh
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install-shadowsocksr.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Installer**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install-shadowsocksr.sh 2>&1 | tee shadowsocksR.log
   ```

The script will prompt you for configuration preferences and handle all dependencies and service setup automatically.

---

## Uninstallation

To remove the ShadowsocksR server from your system, simply run:

```bash
sudo ./install-shadowsocksr.sh uninstall
```

---

## Managing the ShadowsocksR Service

Use the following commands to control the SSR service:

- **Start**:
  ```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/shadowsocks start
  ```

- **Stop**:
  ```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/shadowsocks stop
  ```

- **Restart**:
  ```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/shadowsocks restart
  ```

## Configuration Options (During Setup)

The script allows for full customization of your SSR instance at the time of installation:

- **Password**  
  - Default: Randomly generated  
  - Custom: You may enter your own password when prompted

- **Port**  
  - Default: Random port between `9000`â€“`19999`  
  - Custom: Enter a preferred port during setup

- **Stream Cipher**  
  - Default: `aes-192-cfb`  
  - Supported: `none`, `aes-256-cfb`, `chacha20`, etc.

- **Protocol**  
  - Default: `auth_sha1_v4`  
  - Supported: `origin`, `auth_chain_a`, `auth_chain_f`, etc.

- **Obfuscation**  
  - Default: `tls1.2_ticket_auth`  
  - Supported: `http_simple`, `http_post`, `tls1.2_ticket_fastauth`, etc.

---

## Firewall Configuration

The script automatically configures the necessary firewall rules to open your chosen port for both TCP and UDP:

- On **CentOS 6**: Uses `iptables`
- On **CentOS 7+**: Uses `firewalld`

If you're on a minimal installation without a firewall pre-configured, you can use the included `open-ports.sh` script to open ports manually.

---

## Advanced Features

- **Python 3.10+ Support**  
  The script detects and adapts to newer Python versions by fetching updated SSR components for compatibility and performance.

- **Automatic Dependency Resolution**  
  The installer takes care of all required packages such as `python`, `openssl`, `wget`, and others, making it compatible with both Red Hat- and Debian-based distributions.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Permission Errors**  
  Make sure the script is executed with `sudo` or as the root user.

- **Firewall Issues**  
  Verify that the selected port is open for both TCP and UDP, and that your serverâ€™s security group (if applicable) allows traffic.

- **Python Not Installed**  
  Install Python 3 if missing:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3
  ```

- **Installation Failure**  
  Check the `shadowsocksR.log` file for errors or review your systemâ€™s missing dependencies.
